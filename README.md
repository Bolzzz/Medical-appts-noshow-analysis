# data_wrangling_project
## Medical appointment no-shows

This repository contains files (.ipynb, .csv,. html,. pdf) used to complete the first project in the Udacity Data Analysis nanodegree.

The wrangling steps were conducted on a dataset that contains information about (missed or otherwise) medical appointments across clinics in Brazil.
The aim was to compare independent variables to see what could have contributed to the rate of 'no shows'.
